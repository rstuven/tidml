# Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier Engine

## Run

```
python -m examples.gnb_classifier
```

## Configuration

This example uses a YAML file (`config.yaml`) to configure the engine,
including which classes implement each component and parameter values.

## DataSource

Training data is the *iris* dataset built in scikit-learn.

## Preparator

This example does not implement a preparator, so the default one is used
(`IdentityPreparator`) which just passes the training data through.

## Algorithm

This is a wrapper around scikit-learn to train a gaussian naive bayes model.

By default, the model is persisted to a file using pickle format
(see `PickleModelPersistor`). The file path is configured
with parameter `model.pickle`.

## Serving

In this example, serving class converts the species code to species name,
making it more presentable.
